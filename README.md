# ProximityChat

This minecraft mod implements a simple proximity based chat.

## Requirements

- JDK 8 installed (not just JRE)

## Installation

First clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/SamScherf/ProximityChat.git
cd ProximityChat/
```

Next run the gradlew Decompose script

```
./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace
```

Lastly, to compile into a jar that can be put in your mods folder, run the gradlew build script like so:

```

The resulting jar file be placed in the folder 'build/libs/'
